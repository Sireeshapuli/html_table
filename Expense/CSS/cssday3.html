        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Regular exercise can help prevent disease as well as contribute to emotional wellness because of the feel-good chemicals released during and after physical activity.</p>
        <p>The recommended amount of weekly exercise is 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or 75 minutes of high-intensity aerobic activity.</p>

        <h3>Nutritious Diet</h3>
        <p> “A balanced diet is extremely important; it keeps you healthy now and is an investment for your future health, too,” Takher said.</p>
        <p>Remember that the sources of these nutrients are not created equally, as there are both good and bad carbs, proteins and fat.</p>
        <P>• 40 to 60 percent carbohydrates<br>
        
            • 10 to 30 percent protein<br>
            
            • 10 to 30 percent fat</P>

<h3>Good Sleep</h3>
<p>To optimize sleep, commit to a regular sleep schedule; always wake up and go to bed at the same time every day (even on weekends), avoid naps and don’t hit the snooze button in the morning.</p>
<p>People ages 16 to 60 should aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep nightly. People ages 65 and over should aim for 7 to 8 hours.</p>
